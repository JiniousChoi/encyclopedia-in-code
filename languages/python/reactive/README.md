Event based systems can dynamically react to different situations in smart ways and the ReactiveX library enables to do this in a such a way that our code is succinct and easy to follow.


## Differences between Reactive and Event-Driven Programming

It should be noted that there are some subtle differences between both event-driven programming and that of reactive programming. 
Event-driven programming focuses on handling events such as, for example, a button click and is the paradigm that most operating systems are based upon. If you perform an action within an operating system, the os will treat that as an event and trigger the corresponding function for that action.

Reactive programming on the other hand treats data passed into reactive systems as events. You could have a reactive system listen for stock price changes and only trigger an action to happen when a stock reaches a certain price.


## Conclusion

here are an almost infinite amount of different things you could do with this library. You could for instance have a Twitter bot scan for tweets based on a certain keyword and whenever a new tweet appears it could trigger an event.
